This is a C++ program that simulates a coin-flip game. The player pays a fixed cost to play, and the game continues flipping a coin until the first "heads" appears. The winnings are calculated based on the number of flips it takes to get the first heads. The program tracks the player's balance and provides a fun and interactive way to simulate the game.
