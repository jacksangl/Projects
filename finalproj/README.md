Overview

The Coin Flip Game is a fun and interactive terminal-based game where players can simulate flipping a coin repeatedly until the first head appears. Each game costs $5.50, and the payout is calculated as $2^(number of tails flipped). The game features ASCII art, animations, and a 100-flip demo mode.

Features

100-Flip Demo Mode: See a visual breakdown of 100 coin flips in color.

Game Mode: Pay $5.50 per game and win based on the number of tails before the first head.

ASCII Art Coins: Each coin flip result (heads or tails) is displayed visually.

Animated Coin Flips: Suspenseful coin flip animation before each result.

Balance Tracking: Keeps track of winnings and losses.
