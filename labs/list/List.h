list1 created from array:

list2 created from array:

Capacity of list2 is 5
list1 created from array: 
6 3 5 1 8 4 7 

list2 created from array: 
1 5 15 23 3 
Capacity of list2 is 5
Change the capacity of list 2 to 50.
After the change of capacity, list2 becomes: 
1 5 15 23 3 
Inserting more elements to the expanded list2.
After the insertion, list2 becomes: 
44 43 42 41 40 39 38 37 36 35 34 33 32 31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 5 15 23 3 

Removing elements from the until its size is 10.
But the capacity still remains at 50
After the removal of elements, list2 becomes: 
4 3 2 1 0 1 5 15 23 3 
Try strinking the capacity. After this, list2 becomes: 
4 3 2 1 0 1 5 15 23 3 
The capacity of list 2 is 25
